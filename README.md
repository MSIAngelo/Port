##      Hola a todos, Hello Everyone!

My name is Michael Tavarez. I'm currently a student in NECC (Northern Essex Community College) taking Linux Administration as I close my associates journey in IT.

##      Things about me:

I've been in the United States for 13 years. I currently serve in the Massachusetts Army National Guard, and my favorite cuisine is Asian food.
I'm a great weapon's shooter. One of my favorite things is to do is hike and camp.
